    "## 1. My Subjective Experience of Being Tutored\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session 1 – Unstructured\n",
    "This session felt very **informational** and straightforward, but not particularly engaging.  \n",
    "The tutor gave me a lot of long, detailed explanations right away, almost like reading a well-organized article. I did learn some new ideas about authenticity, but the experience was mostly **passive** I was being told things rather than discovering them myself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It rarely asked about what I already knew or how I was thinking about the topic. When I went off-topic (“I like to play tennis”), it immediately switched to that new subject instead of guiding me back. That made the session feel more like chatting with a general assistant than being taught by a tutor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Emotionally, it was polite and professional, but kind of flat. I didn’t feel much encouragement or challenge — more like I was reading notes than having a conversation.  \n",
    "Overall, I came out with **a lot of facts**, but not a deeper understanding or reflection about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session 2 – Structured (Mollick Prompt)\n",
    "This session felt completely different. The tutor introduced itself clearly, explained what we were going to do, and asked about my goals and background first. That made the conversation feel more **personal and intentional**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It constantly invited me to think and respond, asking open-ended questions like “Would you say these different presentations make you inauthentic?” instead of just explaining everything. That questioning made me stop and actually think about how I define authenticity, rather than just absorbing information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed it built on what I said, validated my ideas (“Excellent observation!”), and pushed me to go deeper. When I went off-topic (“I like to play tennis”), it didn’t just follow me — it politely acknowledged the shift and asked if I wanted to keep going with our current topic or change focus. That felt very natural and human.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this session felt like I was being **coached and challenged**, not just informed. I ended up forming my own definition of authenticity and understanding the complexity behind it.\n",

    "\n",
    "| Tutoring Element | Session 1 | Session 2 |\n",
    "|------------------|------------|------------|\n",
    "| **Opening** | Began with “I’d be happy to help you as a tutor!” friendly but generic. | Opened with “Hello! I'm AI Tutor…”  more confident and personable. |\n",
    "| **Questions** | Mostly closed, like “Would you like me to elaborate?” which didn’t invite thought. | Open-ended and reflective, like “Would you say these different presentations make you inauthentic?” |\n",
    "| **Explanations** | Delivered long, formal paragraphs of information. | Used examples, follow-ups, and smaller chunks of explanation. |\n",
    "| **Feedback tone** | Neutral; rarely praised or affirmed my responses. | Encouraging; said things like “Excellent observation!” or “That’s a thoughtful point.” |\n",
    "| **Topic control** | Lost focus easily — switched topics without connection. | Handled distractions well and brought me back to the main idea. |\n",
    "| **Structure** | No clear direction; I didn’t know where we were headed. | Clear progression toward a goal (developing my own definition of authenticity). |\n",
    "| **Empathy** | Polite but distant. | Supportive and attentive; felt like it was actually listening. |\n",

    "| **Handling distractions** | 1 / 5 – just changed subjects | 5 / 5 – noticed and redirected effectively |\n",

    "## 4. My Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Session 1**, the AI acted more like an *information provider*. It explained things clearly, but it didn’t teach me how to think about the topic. There was no structure or goal, just lots of content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Session 2**, the AI acted like an actual *tutor*. It used open-ended questions, gave me space to reflect, and adapted to what I said. The structure\n"
